"""
Lifetime earnings profiles for OG-ETH.

The ability matrix e starts from the OG-USA profiles, which are estimated
on US micro data, and is reshaped with Ethiopian data along its two
dimensions: over age with the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) labor
income profile per worker, as an Ethiopia-to-United-States ratio; and
across lifetime-income groups so that the income shares the matrix
implies equal the World Inequality Database (WID) pre-tax income shares
for Ethiopia. A caller can pass other target shares, or a single Gini
coefficient to tilt the groups to instead.
