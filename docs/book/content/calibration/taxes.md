The government is not an optimizing agent in `OG-ETH`. The government levies taxes on household income, corporate income, and value added. With these resources, the government provides transfers to households, spends resources on public goods, and makes rule-based adjustments to stabilize the economy in the long-run. The government can run budget deficits or surpluses in a given year and must, therefore, be able to accumulate debt or savings.  The spending and debt parameters are discussed in Chapter {ref}`Chap_MacroCalib`.  Taxes are discussed in this chapter.


## Personal income taxes
The government sector influences households through two terms in the household budget constraint {eq}`EqHHBC`---government transfers $TR_{t}$ and through the total tax liability function $T_{s,t}$, which can be decomposed into the effective tax rate times total income. In this chapter, we detail the household tax component of government activity $T_{s,t}$ in `OG-ETH`.

```{math}
:label: EqHHBC
  c_{j,s,t} + b_{j,s+1,t+1} &= (1 + r_{hh,t})b_{j,s,t} + w_t e_{j,s} n_{j,s,t} + \\
  &\quad\quad\zeta_{j,s}\frac{BQ_t}{\lambda_j\omega_{s,t}} + \eta_{j,s,t}\frac{TR_{t}}{\lambda_j\omega_{s,t}} + ubi_{j,s,t} - T_{s,t}  \\
  &\quad\forall j,t\quad\text{and}\quad s\geq E+1 \quad\text{where}\quad b_{j,E+1,t}=0\quad\forall j,t
```

The total tax function, $T_{s,t}$, is a function of personal income taxes, taxes on bequests, and wealth taxes.  In the default calibration, wealth and bequest taxes are set to zero in `OG-ETH`. Personal income taxes are modeled as linear taxes and set to average effective and marginal tax rates.  The [OG-Core documentation](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-Core/content/theory/government.html#taxes) details more detailed ways to match the progressivity of the tax system.  But given limited data for Ethiopia, we use simple linear tax rates: a {glue:text}`mtrx_rate` marginal rate on labor income and a {glue:text}`mtry_rate` marginal rate on capital income.  The effective average rate of {glue:text}`etr_rate` is the rate faced by the formal, tax-compliant minority; the next subsection explains how informality is handled so that this rate does not fall on the whole population.

### Informality and tax noncompliance

Ethiopia's income tax reaches only a fraction of the population. About 85 percent of employment is informal (ILO, 2021), and the great majority of workers are self-employed in agriculture or small unregistered enterprises that never remit income tax. This is not a hole in the model's output: `OG-ETH`'s macro calibration rests on national-accounts data, which already imputes informal activity into GDP, so the model contains the informal economy's output, capital, and labour. What informality changes is the *tax boundary* — who actually remits the income tax that is owed. An earlier calibration missed this distinction, applying a single blended flat rate (a 3 percent effective and 20 percent marginal rate) to every household and thereby spreading Ethiopia's income-tax burden evenly across an economy where, in reality, a small formal minority pays close to statutory rates and the informal majority pays nothing. That both misstates who faces which incentives and imposes a spurious work-and-saving wedge on the roughly 90 percent of households the income tax does not reach.

We therefore model informality as graded tax *non-compliance* by lifetime-income group, using the `labor_income_tax_noncompliance_rate` and `capital_income_tax_noncompliance_rate` parameters (a value of 1 means none of the tax owed is remitted, 0 means full compliance).  Lifetime income serves as a proxy for formality: the seven lifetime-income groups carry population weights of 25, 25, 20, 10, 10, 9, and 1 percent, and we set noncompliance to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.5, 0] across them.  The bottom five groups — 90 percent of households, close to the ILO's 85 percent informal-employment share — remit none of the income tax they owe; the sixth group, partly-visible higher earners, remits half; the top 1 percent complies fully.  Labour and capital noncompliance are set equal, and every group is still treated as a filer (`income_tax_filer` = 1): informality here is non-remittance, not non-filing.

Because compliance scales both the average and the marginal rate, the {glue:text}`etr_rate` effective rate and {glue:text}`mtrx_rate` marginal rate above fall only on the compliant.  The effective rate is not chosen by hand; it is solved from a revenue identity, so that the compliant-group rate applied to the compliance-weighted income base reproduces observed collections.  With this compliance vector, personal income tax collects 1.4 percent of GDP in the first model period against a data anchor of 1.4 percent ([IMF Selected Issues Paper 2025/108](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/selected-issues-papers), = Country Report 25/189, para 9, average of FY2021/22–2023/24).  The rate was re-solved when the earnings profiles were recalibrated ({ref}`Chap_LfEarn`): the two compliant groups now earn a larger share of labor income, so the same collections need a lower rate, 12.1 percent instead of the 13.1 percent that went with the US-shaped profiles.  The *effective* average income-tax rate then rises across the distribution — zero for the bottom five groups, 6.0 percent for the sixth, and 12.1 percent for the top — a graded schedule rather than the old flat 3 percent on everyone.  Removing the spurious wedge the flat rate had placed on informal households raises steady-state output by roughly 7 percent; the steady-state validation is reported in {ref}`Chap_MacroCalib`.

Several of these choices are judgment calls, stated plainly: lifetime income is a proxy for formality, not sector of work, so high-income informality cannot be represented; the sixth group's half-compliance is a judgment, sensitivity-tested and macroeconomically minor (alternative gradings move steady-state output by about ±0.3 percent); there is one economy-wide wage and no formal/informal choice margin, an OG-Core structural limit; and compliance is a proxy for the *fiscal* footprint of the formal sector, not a model of the choice to be formal.

Compliance does move along the transition, because the IMF program's revenue gains are direct-tax heavy: in the first nine months of FY2025/26 federal direct taxes grew 78 percent against 41 percent for domestic VAT and 5 percent for import taxes ({cite}`IMFCR26174:2026`, p. 15), the signature of a broadening tax base rather than of higher rates.  We therefore let the formal tax boundary move down the income distribution over the seven program years, FY2024/25–FY2030/31: the sixth group's non-compliance falls linearly from 0.5 to 0 and the fifth group's from 1 to 0.8, and both then hold, so the vector goes from [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.5, 0] to [1, 1, 1, 1, 0.8, 0, 0].  At the steady-state incidence this adds about 0.7 percent of GDP of personal income tax by FY2030/31; the rest of the program's revenue gain is carried by the consumption-tax rate and corporate-tax collections ({ref}`Sec_ProgramPath`).  The bottom four groups — 80 percent of households — stay entirely outside the income tax: the program formalizes the margin, not the mass of self-employed agriculture.  The paths are built by `ogeth.macro_params.program_compliance_paths` and pinned by `tests/test_fiscal_program.py`.

We model payroll taxes as a flat {glue:text}`payroll_rate` rate.  Ethiopia's *statutory* pension contribution is 18 percent of covered salary (11 percent employer + 7 percent employee, per [this PwC summary](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ethiopia/individual/other-taxes#:~:text=Employers%20are%20required%20to%20contribute,employee's%20contribution%20is%20at%207%25)), but that rate applies only to permanent employees of the formal public and private sectors covered by the two social-security agencies (POESSA and the public-servants scheme).  In an economy where the great majority of workers are self-employed in agriculture or the informal sector, formal-pension coverage is only a single-digit-to-low-teens share of the labour force, so the *economy-wide effective* payroll rate — statutory rate times the covered share of the wage bill — is far below 18 percent.  We set it to 0.03.  The relevant weight is the covered share of the *wage bill*, not of headcount: covered formal employees (public servants and large-firm private workers) earn well above the mean wage, so a headcount coverage near 8–10 percent corresponds to a larger ~15–17 percent share of taxable wages, i.e. $0.18 \times \sim0.17 \approx 0.03$.  An earlier calibration applied the full 18 percent economy-wide, which (with no offsetting pension benefit, since the benefit-formula parameters are zero) overstated tax revenue by roughly five percentage points of GDP; see the steady-state validation in {ref}`Chap_MacroCalib`.

Public pensions themselves are switched off in the model: the packaged calibration sets every rate and payment of OG-Core's US-style social-security formula to zero (`PIA_rate_bkt_1`–`3`, `PIA_maxpayment`, `PIA_minpayment`), so the replacement rate is zero, no household draws a model pension, and the payroll contribution acts as a pure tax.  That is close to the fiscal reality — pension payouts are about half a percent of GDP and are carried inside the cash-transfer ratio $\alpha_T$ ({ref}`Chap_MacroCalib`) — but it means the model has no contributory pension for the formal minority.  So that any future pension calibration inherits the formality boundary, `replacement_rate_adjust` is set by lifetime-income group to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 1]: no public pension for the five informal groups, half for the sixth, full for the top group, mirroring the compliance vector and the coverage of the two agencies.

## Corporate income taxes

`OG-ETH` uses the statutory rate of {glue:text}`cit_rate` for the corporate income tax rate.  Because informal and exempt firms mean corporate collections fall well short of what the statutory rate applied to the whole capital stock would imply, the effective corporate tax is scaled by `adjustment_factor_for_cit_receipts` (together with `c_corp_share_of_assets`).  We set this factor to {glue:text}`cit_adj_factor`, chosen so that corporate income tax collects 1.71 percent of GDP against a 1.7 percent anchor ([IMF Selected Issues Paper 2025/108](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/selected-issues-papers), para 9); the previous value of 0.2 was undocumented and under-stated collections.  Modelled direct taxes then total 3.10 percent of GDP, matching the 3.1 percent reported for FY2024/25 ([IMF Country Report 26/20](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/cr/issues/2026/01/29/the-federal-democratic-republic-of-ethiopia-fourth-review-under-the-extended-573522), Table 2b).

## Value-added taxes

An *effective* consumption-tax rate of {glue:text}`tau_c_rate` is applied with the `tau_c` parameter.  Ethiopia's statutory VAT rate is 15 percent (unchanged under VAT Proclamation 1341/2024), but the effective rate on aggregate consumption is far lower because of exemptions, a large informal and subsistence economy, and incomplete compliance.  In FY2024/25 domestic indirect taxes plus import duties and taxes were about 4.3 percent of GDP against private consumption of about 81 percent of GDP (a roughly 5.3 percent effective rate), per the [World Bank Inclusive Growth DPO Program Document](https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099060226161033684) (May 2026) and [World Bank WDI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.ZS?locations=ET).  We set $\tau_c = 0.06$, slightly above the FY2024/25 realized rate, reflecting the ongoing broadening of the consumption-tax base (a 30 percent fuel excise effective December 2025 and the VAT base-broadening under Proclamation 1341/2024).
